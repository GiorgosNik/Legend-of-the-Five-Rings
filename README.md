# Legend-of-the-Five-Rings

## Description and Motivation
This project is an implementation of the turn-based card game "Legend of the Five Rings. The game is set in feudal Japan, where any number of players battle each other to achieve suppremacy over income-producing fiefs and castles. The game features different sets of cards, each with their own attributes, types, subtypes and so on, and as such this project serves as a good example to demonstrate the concept of inheritance as well as other aspects of object oriented programming.

## Compiling and playing the game
The game can be compiled using the provide makefile, using `make all`. To remove the object files, which are not needed any more, use `make clean`. To start the game, run `game`. Following the instructions, set the number and names of the players and other game options. The game is turn based, with each player's turn consisting of several phases, during which the player can perform different tasks, such as drawing cards, buying provinces, equiping units with different weapons and armors, attacking other playes etc. For a detailed look at the rules, watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Mpjaobv4o&ab_channel=Geek%26Sundry) is recomended, as they are quite in depth.
